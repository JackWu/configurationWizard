This guide walks you through the process of running configuration wizard in your dev environment

== Requirements

You'll need to install the following tools and set their path into your system PATH:

	gradle
	gulp
	node js
	

== First Step (Back end service)

You'll open up a cmd.exe with administrative privileges, and cd into complete folder

    gradle bootrun

and open your browser and point to localhost:8080/greeting

    "Hello, World!"

That means your backend api is up and running



== Second Step

You'll open up another cmd.exe with aministrative priviledges, and cd into yoGolpAngular
	
	gulp serve

Your browser will immediately open up and point to localhost:3000


== Final Thought
Will use Launch4j to package everything into .exe
